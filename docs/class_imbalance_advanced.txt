# Advanced Research on Class Imbalance

Recent work explores deep learning and generative models for class imbalance.

## Deep Learning Solutions
- Data augmentation with GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).
- Variational Autoencoders for synthetic data generation.
- Transfer learning: Use pre-trained models on balanced datasets, then fine-tune.

## Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- AUC-ROC and AUC-PR (more reliable for imbalance)
- G-Mean (balances sensitivity and specificity)
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

## Emerging Trends
- Few-shot learning for extreme imbalance
- Federated learning with imbalanced local datasets
- Handling multi-class imbalance, not just binary
