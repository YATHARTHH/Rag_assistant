# Introduction to Class Imbalance in Machine Learning

Class imbalance occurs when certain classes in a dataset are significantly underrepresented compared to others. 
For example, in fraud detection, only ~1% of transactions may be fraudulent while 99% are normal. 
This imbalance creates challenges for machine learning models, as they tend to be biased toward the majority class.

## Key Issues
- Poor recall for minority classes
- High accuracy but misleading results
- Difficulty in learning rare but critical patterns

## Real-World Examples
- Fraud detection (fraudulent transactions vs. legitimate)
- Medical diagnosis (rare diseases vs. healthy patients)
- Fault detection in engineering systems
